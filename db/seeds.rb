  "Catsy is a very cute cat. Everyone likes her very much. She used to roam from place to place and loved everyone by saying meow. Catsy loved drinking milk. She makes many things from milk like – ice cream, cheese, and cream. Water comes into her mouth when she saw milk.
  Every day Milky Cow used to come and give milk to Catsy. But one day the Milky cow suddenly did not come and Catsy did not get her milk. In such a situation she was very sad but then she thought why not go to Milky Cow’s house and bring milk.
  Now Catsy tied a handkerchief around her neck, put a cap on her head, and came out with a car key in her hand. Catsy also had a cute little bottle in her hand which had a picture of a cat on it and it was written on it, ‘Catsy The Cat Meow Meow’.
  While going, she thought that where would she go? Catsy didn’t know the way to Milky’s house. She thought, “Who is the one who knows the way to Milky’s house?”
  Catsy remembered that there is a knowledgeable owl in the city who knows everything. Now Catsy will first go to the Gyan Owl’s house.
  Catsy swung the car and moved towards Gyan Owl’s house. After reaching the owl’s house, she started loudly ringing the horn of the car, ‘Pe Pe Pe Poooooo.’
  The owl came out from inside and said, “Don’t shout! Don’t shout! I am coming”
  “It’s me, Catsy your sweet cat meow meow,” said Catsy.
  “Oh my dear Catsy, you came here after a long time. What’s the matter?” The Gyan owl said.
  Catsy asks, “I don’t know the way to Milky Cow’s house. Can you tell me the way?”
  The owl said, “Oh wow! You are going to Milky’s house. You are so good I have to give some stuff to Milky.”
  Then the owl asked, “Will you give these kinds of stuff to the Milky?”
  Catsy said, “Yes, I will definitely. Put all the stuff behind the car.”
  After picking up the luggage the owl told Catsy the way to Milky’s house. Catsy then turned on her car and moved towards Milky’s house.",
"In a small town, a cat came hiding in people’s homes and people named it kitty. Kitty used to come to everyone’s house and drink milk and sometimes eat food. People slowly started getting worried about this.
People thought of catching the kitty. For this, they laid a trap for the kitty.
At night, Kitty went out in search of her food but she fell into that trap. After being caught in the trap, she was kept in captivity for several days.
Kitty screamed fondly, “meow meow meow meow”
Seeing Kitty upset, a girl named Lily thought of taking care of her and making her a pet. Lily brought Kitty to her home and put a ringing bell around her neck.
When Kitty moves her bell sounds, “ting ting ting”.
Lily would give good food to the kitty every day and also give her milk. But Kitty enjoyed going to others’ homes to eat stolen food.
Kitty started to go out at night and went to the others’ houses. But now she gets nothing. People would hide the food after hearing the sound of her ringing the bell. Whatever the kitty tries, she does not get anything.
In such a situation, Kitty enlisted the help of her friend Rat. The rat bit the kitty’s bell with his tooth. Rat helped kitty to get rid of a ringing bell.
Now the kitty was free again. People no longer know when the kitty comes and goes. Now Kitty is smarter than ever.",
"This is the story of a black cat, a red cat, and a monkey. Both the cats were good friends among themselves. The two set out together in search of food. They used to eat fish and various food together.
One day both of them got a piece of bread then both of them decided that they would eat it equally by sharing it among themselves.
The cats made two pieces of bread and shared them among themselves.
In such a situation, the black cat said to the red cat, “Look, my piece of bread is small and your piece is big.”
The red cat said, “No, my bread is smaller than your bread, I should get more bread.”
Both of them got into an argument over a piece of bread. This debate lasted between them. To resolve this problem both of them decided that they will go to someone else and take the right decision.
Both the black cat and the red cat went to the monkey and said, “You tell us, the monkey who has a big piece of bread?”
The monkey took out his scales and said, “Don’t worry both of you, I will do justice to both of you now.”
The monkey placed a piece of bread on each side of the scales. The monkey saw that a piece came down because it was heavy. Seeing this, the monkey said, “Hey, a piece of it is heavy. I have to make it equal.”
Saying this, the monkey broke a small piece of bread and ate it.
Now the other part of the scales became heavy due to which that part came down. The monkey said, “Hey, a piece of it is heavy. I have to make it equal.”
Saying this, the monkey again broke a small piece of bread and ate it. While doing so, the monkey ate whole bread.
Both cats understand that the monkey is making them stupid.
The cats said, “We came to you for justice and you were the one who made us stupid.”
After that, both cats went away. Now both of them understood that greed does not help in the end.

"There used to be a lot of rats in a big house. There were more than 100 rats in that house. They lived in that house very happily. Everyone got enough food to eat and drink. But everything was going to change.
One day suddenly a big cat entered that house. As soon as that cat entered that house. All the rats entered the holes on seeing that cat. Everyone hid in their holes. The cat had never seen so many mice together. Seeing so many mice, the cat’s mouth became watery and she started thinking that she would eat everyone one by one.
As the night approached, the cat would hide in the dark and wait for the mice to come out. At night, the rats went out in search of food and the cat would hunt them one by one. Cat’s terror was increasing day by day. Those mice could not understand how they would escape from the cat. Because the cat was very clever.
In such a situation, the mice called a meeting. All the mice of the house were present in that assembly. Everyone was discussing how to avoid the cat. People gave a lot of suggestions one after the other but none of the suggestions were accurate.
Then an old rat came in front of them and said that they should all tie a bell to the cat’s neck so that they can escape from that cat. As soon as the cat goes or comes, they will know from the sound of the bell where the cat is?
People liked this suggestion very much and on hearing this, all the rats started dancing with fun. All were dancing with joy when a sensible rat shouted them out loud and told them that the danger is still not averted. To do this, all of them must first tie a bell to that cat’s neck. This will be very difficult to do. Hearing this, all the rats again got frustrated thinking that who would tie the bell in the neck of that cat?
While they were talking about this, everyone heard the cat’s voice and everyone ran away and hid in their respective holes. But no one could tie the bell to that cat’s neck and that cat kept hunting those mice.",
"Once upon a time, a cat and a fox were walking among themselves in the forest then the fox was praising her. While praising her, she said, “I am very clever. I know the solution to avoid every problem. I have hundreds of ways to avoid a problem. There is no one like me.”
Listening to the fox, the cat said, “Hey! I know only one way to avoid trouble and use it every time.”
The two were moving forward talking with each other. While both of them were walking in the forest, they heard the sound of wild dogs. In such a situation, both of them got scared and started running away from there. Slowly the dogs reach them. The cat immediately climbed the tree without thinking. The fox, on the other hand, could not think of what she would do while running. The dogs were following her.
Then the cat said to her, “Hey! Hurry otherwise the wild dogs will kill you. You were saying that you have hundreds of ways to avoid problems. Use one of them and save yourself from wild dogs.”
She listened to the cat but the fox still could not think what she would do. The wild dogs increased their speed together and the fox was tired. Due to fatigue, the speed of the fox was decreasing. Finally, the wild dogs catch the fox and kill him.
On the other hand, the cat climbed into the tree and saved his life. But he regrets that he lost his friend."
